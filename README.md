# second_node_site

Making a multi-page Node.js site, taking full advantage of the express framework. This is meant to be a followup from my [beginning_node](https://github.com/HeapsOfRam/beginning_node) project.

I am simply following [this tutorial](https://www.shapeshed.com/creating-a-basic-site-with-node-and-express). Thank you George Ornbo for your article.
